### Treehouse FSJS Project 3 - Interactive Form

<hr>

<b> Project Description: </b>

I used javaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf." I used the jQuery library in order to add customized and conditional behavior with interactivity. Also validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
